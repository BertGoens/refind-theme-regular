# refind-theme-regular

A simplistic clean and minimal theme for rEFInd, with presets for normal and HD monitors, like the macbook. It's a beautifull theme for super-users.

When starting your computer it presents you all your operating systems, and an icon detailing from where you will boot. Along with some tools including: a command prompt, reboot and shutdown options, and more.
